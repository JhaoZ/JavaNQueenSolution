# JavaNQueenSolution
Just a simple backtracking solution to the famous N Queen problem in Java.

From wikipedia:
"The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3"

This is a typical example of backtracking, a from of recursive problem solving that exhausts many solutions.
It abandons a solution once it realizes that it can't be completed unde any circumstance, and it will backtrack to the last point (which in this case is usually the first queen place)

This is JAVA. I have provided some explanations that may help, but if not enough, many youtube videos explain this in great detail.
